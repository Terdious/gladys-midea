# Changelog

All notable changes to this integration are documented in this file. The format
follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project
uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).

Describe each change under `## [Unreleased]` as you make it. The Release
workflow moves that section under the version it ships, and the section becomes
the notes of the version's GitHub Release.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Actions "Diagnostic of the units" and "Test a unit" (Configuration tab,
  read-only): a text report to paste into a GitHub issue, with the
  configuration, the discovery, each unit's protocol, keys, last answer and
  last error, and, for the test, every query of the unit with its raw answer
  and decoding. A typed address of an appliance not supported yet gets its
  discovery answer. Tokens, keys and passwords are never shown; ids, serial
  numbers and local addresses are masked unless asked.
- Air-to-water heat pumps (Midea appliance type `0xC3`, "Heat Pump Wi-Fi
  Controller" such as the 171H120F), ported from midea-local: one Gladys device
  per heat pump with the mode and setpoint of each heating zone (thermostat),
  domestic hot water on/off and setpoint (water heater), tank, outdoor, water
  inlet and outlet temperatures, eco and silent modes, power draw and energy
  consumed. Setpoints stay within the limits the unit announces; the "Unit
  error" trigger covers heat pumps too (guim31/gladys-midea#5).
- Heat pumps, beyond the Home Assistant integration's controls: operating
  state of each zone, hot water heating, compressor, defrosting and backup
  electric heater, water flow and pressure, compressor run time, heat
  produced (for the COP), weather curve of each zone, super silent mode, and
  the error code as the controller shows it (E8, P1...).
- Trigger "Unit error": new variable `error_display`, the code the unit
  shows.
- Setting "Token and key typed by hand": the token and key of a V3 unit the
  Midea cloud gives no key for, as Home Assistant's Midea AC LAN keeps them.
- `scripts/probe.mjs --host` reads a heat pump too, and takes a V3 token and
  key from `MIDEA_TOKEN` and `MIDEA_KEY`.

### Changed

- The search report counts "Midea units" rather than air conditioners.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-10-13

### Added

- Local control of Midea air conditioners (appliance type `0xAC`) and of the
  units of related brands set up in the SmartHome / MSmartHome, NetHome Plus,
  Midea Air, Toshiba AC NA or Arctic King apps, over the Midea LAN protocol
  (V2 and V3).
- One Gladys device per unit: on/off, mode, setpoint (by half degrees), fan
  speed, vertical and horizontal swing, indoor and outdoor temperature, indoor
  humidity, eco, turbo and sleep modes, power draw and energy consumed — only
  the features and the options the unit announces.
- Automatic discovery through the Gladys core (mediated UDP broadcast on ports
  6445 and 20086), typed IP addresses for the units it does not find, and a
  "Search for air conditioners" action that lists every unit and its state.
- The key of the V3 units is fetched once from the Midea cloud (public
  NetHome Plus accounts by region, or your own account), kept in `/data`, and
  fetched again when the unit is paired again; everything else is local.
- The units are read by the integration itself every 30 seconds by default
  (15 s to 5 min), only the changes are sent to Gladys, with a reminder every
  6 hours.
- Scene triggers "Filter needs cleaning" and "Unit error" (with the error
  code), and a scene action "Run the air conditioner" that sets mode, setpoint
  and fan in one command.
- A dashboard widget "Air conditioner": room, setpoint and outdoor
  temperature, mode, fan, filter and error code, with on/off, setpoint and
  "Mode and fan" buttons.
- Names, messages and documentation in English, French, German and Spanish.
